## Mitigations
- [Patching](./Patching.md)
- [Data Execution Prevention](./Data_Execution_Prevention.md)
- [Address Space Layout Randomization](./ASLR.md)
	- To make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory.
- [Principle of Least Privilege](./PoLP.md)
	- Eg running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token. Reduces the ability of buffer overrun exploits to run as elevated user.
- [Code Signing](./Code_Signing.md)
	- Requiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.
- [Compiler Security Features](./Compiler_Security_Features.md)
	- Use of compilers that trap buffer overruns.
- [Encryption](./Encryption.md)
	- Of software and/or firmware components.
- [Mandatory Access Controls](./MAC.md)
	- MACs
	- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	- Operating systems with Mandatory Access Controls - eg. SELinux.
- [Insecure by Exception](./Insecure_by_Exception.md)
	- When to allow people to do certain things for their job, and how to improve everything else. Don't try to "fix" security, just improve it by 99%.
- [Do Not Blame the User](./Do_Not_Blame_the_User.md)
	- Security is about protecting people, we should build technology that people can trust, not constantly blame users.
