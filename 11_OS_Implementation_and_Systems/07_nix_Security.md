# *nix Security
## 1. SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)
  - What It Is
    - **A Linux kernel security module** that provides **Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to enforce strict security policies**.
  - Key Features
    - **Labels and Policies**
      - Every file, process, and resource has a **security context** (e.g., user_u:role_r:type_t).
    - **Enforcing Modes**
      - Enforcing: Policies are applied, and violations are blocked.
      - Permissive: Violations are **logged but not blocked** (useful for debugging).
      - Disabled: SELinux is turned off.
    - **Fine-Grained Controls**
      - Restricts processes to only the actions defined in the security policy.
  - Use Cases
    - Isolating services (e.g., confining web servers to specific files and ports).
    - Preventing privilege escalation through misconfigured or vulnerable applications.  
<br>

## 2. Kernel, Userspace, and Permissions
  - **Kernel**
    - The **core component** of Unix/Linux responsible for managing hardware and system resources.
    - Provides an interface for user applications to interact with hardware via system calls.
  - **Userspace**
    - **Non-kernel processes and applications** running on the system.
    - Includes user applications, libraries, and daemons.
  - **Permissions**
    - Unix uses a three-level permission model:
      - **Owner**: The user who owns the file or directory.
      - **Group**: A group of users who can access the file.
      - **Others**: Everyone else.
    - Modes
      - Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x).
      - Permissions are displayed as a 10-character string (e.g., -rw-r--r--).
    - Command: chmod, chown, ls -l.

## 3. MAC vs DAC

| Aspect | Mandatory Access Control (MAC) | Discretionary Access Control (DAC) |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Control | Enforced system-wide by administrators. | Decentralized; owners control permissions. |
| Flexibility | Less flexible; predefined policies. | More flexible but less secure. |
| Example | SELinux, AppArmor | Standard Unix permissions (chmod, chown). |
| Use Case | High-security environments (e.g., servers) | General-purpose systems. |
  
<br>

## 4. /proc
  - What It Is
    - **A virtual filesystem that provides information about processes and system resources**.
  - Common Directories
    - **/proc/<PID>**: Contains details about a specific process.
      - cmdline: Command-line arguments used to start the process.
      - status: Process status and memory usage.
    - /proc/cpuinfo: Information about the CPU.
    - /proc/meminfo: Information about system memory.
    - /proc/net: Network statistics.
  - Forensic Uses
    - Monitoring running processes and their behavior.
    - Identifying rogue processes by inspecting cmdline and fd.  
<br>

## 5. /tmp
  - Purpose
    - **A directory for storing temporary files**. Itâ€™s **world-writable**, meaning any user can create files here.
  - Security Concerns
    - **Code Execution**
      - Attackers can save malicious scripts or binaries in /tmp and execute them.
    - **Symbolic Link Attacks**
      - Creating symbolic links in /tmp to sensitive files for privilege escalation.
  - Mitigations
    - **Mount /tmp with the noexec option** to prevent execution of binaries
    - Regularly **clean /tmp** to remove potentially harmful files.  

```
mount -o remount,noexec /tmp
```
  
<br>

## 6. /shadow
  - What It Is
    - A file that **stores hashed passwords for user accounts**.
    - Located at /etc/shadow and **readable only by the root user**.
  - Structure
    - Each line corresponds to a user  

```
username:hashed_password:last_change:min_days:max_days:warn_days:inactive_days:expire
```

  - Security Concerns:
    - If compromised, attackers can use tools like **John the Ripper** or **Hashcat** to crack the hashes.
    - Common hash formats:
      - $6$: SHA-512.
      - $5$: SHA-256.
      - $1$: MD5.
  - Best Practices:
    - **Use strong password policies** and **hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-512)**.
    - Limit access to **/etc/shadow**.  
<br>

## 7. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
  - What It Is
    - **A protocol for accessing and managing directory information**.
    - **Commonly used for authentication and user management in Unix environments**.
  - How It Works
    - Centralized management of user credentials and information.
    - Users can authenticate across multiple services (e.g., email, VPN) using a single password.
  - LDAP vs. Active Directory
    - **LDAP is a protocol**, while **Active Directory is a Microsoft directory service that uses LDAP**.
    - LDAP is more lightweight and platform-agnostic, making it ideal for Unix systems.
  - Security Considerations
    - **Encrypt LDAP traffic using LDAPS or StartTLS**.
    - Implement **access controls** to restrict unauthorized access.

## 8. Summary

| Concept | Details |
| ------- | ------- |
| SELinux | Provides MAC, enforcing strict security policies. |
| Kernel/Userspace | Kernel manages resources; userspace includes applications and user-level processes. |
| MAC vs DAC | MAC offers stricter security; DAC provides more flexibility. |
| /proc | Virtual filesystem for process and system information. |
| /tmp | Temporary file storage; vulnerable to code execution without noexec. |
| /shadow | Stores hashed passwords; critical for system security. |
| LDAP | Centralized authentication protocol similar to AD for Unix systems. |

**Unix/Linux systems rely on robust security mechanisms like SELinux, file permissions, and secure configuration of directories like /tmp and /shadow**. By understanding these components and implementing best practices, administrators can build resilient systems that resist common attacks while maintaining operational flexibility.
