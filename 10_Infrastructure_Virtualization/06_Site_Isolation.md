# Site Isolation
Site Isolation is **a security mechanism implemented in modern web browsers to provide stronger isolation between different websites by running each site in its own process**. This prevents one site from accessing or interfering with the data of another site, even in the presence of browser vulnerabilities like speculative execution attacks (e.g., Spectre).

## 1. How Site Isolation Works
  - Traditional Model
    - In older browser architectures, multiple websites could share the same process for rendering.
    - Shared processes could lead to cross-origin data leaks if vulnerabilities were exploited.
  - Site Isolation Model
    - **Each website (or “origin”) is rendered in a separate process**.
    - Process boundaries prevent one site from accessing another site’s data, even if the browser’s renderer is compromised.

### Key Features
1. **Process Separation**
  - Each domain or origin gets its own dedicated process.
  - Example: https://example.com and https://another.com run in different processes.
2. **Cross-Origin Data Protection**
  - Data from one origin (cookies, DOM objects, etc.) cannot be accessed by another origin.
3. **Memory and Cache Isolation**
  - Separate memory spaces for each process prevent leakage of sensitive data between tabs.

## 2. Benefits of Site Isolation
  - **Mitigates Speculative Execution Attacks**
    - Prevents attacks like Spectre from leaking sensitive data by ensuring data resides in isolated processes.
  - **Stronger Sandbox**
    - Each process operates in a stricter sandbox, making it harder for attackers to escalate privileges.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Containment**
    - Even if one site is compromised via XSS, the attack is confined to that process and cannot affect other sites.
  - **Enhanced Privacy**
    - Prevents one site from snooping on another’s data or cookies.  
<br>

## 3. Limitations of Site Isolation
  - Increased Resource Usage
    - Each process consumes memory and CPU resources, leading to higher resource utilization compared to shared processes.
  - **Not a Complete Security Solution**
    - Does not protect against all types of web-based attacks (e.g., phishing or drive-by downloads).
  - Implementation Complexity
    - Requires careful management of inter-process communication to ensure seamless user experience.  
<br>

## 4. Site Isolation in Modern Browsers

### a. Google Chrome
  - Chrome introduced Site Isolation as a key defense against speculative execution attacks (e.g., Spectre).
  - Fully enabled by default since Chrome 67 for desktop and Chrome 77 for Android.

### Command-Line Options
  - Force-enable Site Isolation  

```
chrome.exe --site-per-process
```

### b. Mozilla Firefox
  - Firefox uses a similar feature called Fission to isolate websites in separate processes.
  - Still under phased deployment as of late 2024, with additional tuning for performance.

### c. Microsoft Edge
  - Built on the Chromium engine, Edge inherits Site Isolation features from Chromium.

### d. Apple Safari
  - **Uses a process-per-tab model** but does not implement full site isolation as in Chromium-based browsers.  
<br>

## 5. Attacks Mitigated by Site Isolation
  - **Spectre and Meltdown**
    - Prevents malicious scripts on one site from stealing sensitive data from another site in the same browser session.
  - **Cross-Origin Information Leakage**
    - Blocks unauthorized access to cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data.
  - **Universal XSS (UXSS)**
    - Confines XSS vulnerabilities to a single site, reducing their impact.  
<br>

## 6. Enabling and Testing Site Isolation

### a. Chrome Example
1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://flags.
2. Search for “Strict Site Isolation”.
3. Enable the flag and restart the browser.

### b. Testing Isolation
  - Use online tools like Google’s Spectre Test
    - Confirm that Site Isolation prevents speculative execution leaks.

### c. Debugging Site Isolation
  - Chrome Debugging Command  

```
chrome.exe --site-per-process --disable-features=IsolateOrigins
```
  
<br>

## 7. Best Practices for Developers
  - Avoid Relying on Same-Origin Policies Alone
    - Use additional security headers like Content-Security-Policy (CSP) and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS).
  - Reduce Shared Resources
    - Minimize shared objects between origins to benefit fully from isolation.
  - Test Compatibility
    - Ensure applications are compatible with site isolation policies.

## 8. Summary

| Aspect | Details |
| ------ | ------- |
| What It Is | Isolates websites in separate browser processes for enhanced security. |
| Primary Goal | Protect against cross-origin attacks and speculative execution vulnerabilities. |
| Key Benefits | Data protection, stronger sandboxing, and containment of vulnerabilities. |
| Limitations | Higher resource usage, not a defense against all web threats. |
| Implementation | Supported by Chrome, Edge, Firefox (Fission), with varying levels in Safari. |


**Site Isolation is a critical browser security feature that strengthens defenses against modern threats like speculative execution attacks and cross-origin data leakage**. By isolating each site into its own process, browsers achieve better data protection and containment. While it increases resource consumption, the trade-off is worthwhile for environments requiring strong security, especially in enterprise or cloud applications.
