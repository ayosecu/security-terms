# Hyperjacking
Hyperjacking is **a cyberattack where an attacker takes control of a hypervisor**, enabling them to manipulate or monitor all the virtual machines (VMs) hosted on it. Because hypervisors are critical components in virtualized environments, compromising them gives attackers immense control over the underlying systems.

## 1. How Hyperjacking Works
**Hyperjacking exploits vulnerabilities in the hypervisor or leverages misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or control**.

### a. Exploiting Hypervisor Vulnerabilities
  - Attackers exploit flaws in the hypervisor code or architecture.
  - Example: Bugs in the hypervisor kernel or APIs could allow privilege escalation.

### b. Installing a Malicious Hypervisor
  - An attacker replaces the legitimate hypervisor with a malicious version (a **rogue hypervisor**).
  - Example: A malicious hypervisor is loaded during the system boot process via a compromised bootloader.

### c. Bypassing or Disabling Security Mechanisms
  - Attackers may bypass hypervisor-level protections such as Secure Boot or Intel TXT (Trusted Execution Technology).

### d. Using Side-Channel Attacks
  - Attackers gather information about VM activities through indirect means, such as analyzing resource usage or cache timing.  
<br>

## 2. Consequences of Hyperjacking
  - **Full VM Control**
    - The attacker can monitor, manipulate, or terminate VMs.
  - **Data Exfiltration**
    - Access to VMs allows attackers to extract sensitive information such as credentials, encryption keys, or business data.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS)**
    - Attackers can disrupt all VMs by shutting down or overloading the hypervisor.
  - **Undetectable Malware**
    - Malware running at the hypervisor level is extremely difficult to detect because it operates below the OS layer of the VMs.  
<br>

## 3. Common Attack Techniques

### a. Rogue Hypervisors
  - Attackers replace the original hypervisor with a malicious version.
  - This requires privileged access or exploiting boot processes.

### b. Exploiting Weaknesses in Virtual Machine Escape
  - A VM escape attack occurs when an attacker exploits a flaw in virtualization software to break out of a VM and gain access to the hypervisor.

### c. Side-Channel Attacks
  - Leveraging hardware or hypervisor vulnerabilities to infer sensitive information.
  - Examples: **Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities**.

### d. Man-in-the-Middle on Management Tools
  - Attacking hypervisor management tools (e.g., VMware vSphere) to gain control.  
<br>

## 4. Hyperjacking Prevention

### a. Secure Hypervisor Configuration
  - Use the latest, secure versions of hypervisors (e.g., VMware ESXi, Xen, Hyper-V).
  - Disable unused features and ports.
  - Harden hypervisor APIs and restrict access to management interfaces.

### b. Enable Hardware Security Features
  - Use features like Intel TXT, AMD Secure Virtualization (SEV), or Secure Boot to ensure the integrity of the hypervisor during boot.
  - Enable TPM (Trusted Platform Module) to protect boot processes and keys.

### c. Isolate Management Interfaces
  - Ensure hypervisor management interfaces are accessible only through secure, isolated networks.
  - Implement MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for management tools.

### d. Monitor for Anomalous Behavior
  - Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to monitor hypervisor activity.
  - Track unusual VM behaviors or resource usage patterns that may indicate compromise.

### e. Patch and Update Regularly
  - Apply security patches to the hypervisor and its management tools promptly to address vulnerabilities.

### f. Use Hardware-Assisted Virtualization Protections
  - Ensure hardware-based protections like Intel VT-d are enabled to prevent unauthorized memory access.  
<br>

## 5. Detection Challenges
  - **Limited Visibility**
    - Hypervisor attacks occur below the OS level, making them difficult to detect with traditional security tools.
  - **Sophisticated Attack Techniques**
    - Rogue hypervisors or subtle manipulations of VMs can evade detection.
  - **Dependency on Hypervisor Logs**
    - Attackers may tamper with logs to erase evidence of the attack.  
<br>

## 6. Notable Hyperjacking Scenarios

### a. Cloud Environments
  - Large-scale hypervisor attacks on cloud providers could compromise thousands of VMs simultaneously.
  - Example: **A hypervisor bug in Xen prompted AWS to reboot customer instances in 2015** to patch the vulnerability.

### b. State-Sponsored Attacks
  - Hyperjacking is a powerful tool for nation-state actors seeking to monitor or disrupt critical systems.

### c. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
  - APT groups may use hyperjacking to maintain long-term, stealthy access to targets.

## 7. Comparison to Related Attacks

| Attack Type | Description | Scope |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Hyperjacking | Attacker compromises the hypervisor layer. | All VMs on host. |
| VM Escape | Attacker escapes from a single VM to the host. | One VM or host. |
| Side-Channel Attack | Attacker uses indirect methods to gather information. | Dependent on technique. |

## 8. Summary

| Aspect | Details |
| ------ | ------- |
| What It Is | Taking control of the hypervisor to manipulate or monitor hosted VMs. |
| Attack Vectors | Exploiting vulnerabilities, rogue hypervisors, VM escape, side-channels. |
| Impact | Full control over VMs, data exfiltration, DoS, undetectable malware. |
| Prevention | Secure configurations, hardware security features, patches, and monitoring. |
| Detection Challenges | Hard to detect due to its low-level operation beneath VMs. |

**Hyperjacking represents a critical threat in virtualized and cloud environments**, where hypervisors form the backbone of infrastructure. Organizations must prioritize hardening hypervisor security, isolating management interfaces, and leveraging hardware-assisted protections to prevent such attacks. Detection and prevention require a combination of strong architectural practices and advanced monitoring tools.
