# Multiplexing
Multiplexing is **a technique used in telecommunications and computer networks to combine multiple signals or data streams into a single transmission medium or channel**. By using multiplexing, multiple users or data streams can share the same physical medium (e.g., a cable or a frequency band), improving the efficiency and capacity of communication systems.

## Types of Multiplexing
1. **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)**
  - In TDM, multiple signals share the same channel, but **each signal is assigned a different time slot**. Only one signal transmits at a time, but they alternate so quickly that it appears they are transmitting simultaneously.
  - Example: In **telephone networks**, multiple phone calls can share a single line by being transmitted in alternating time slots.
2. **Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)**
  - In FDM, different signals are transmitted simultaneously over the same channel by **using different frequency ranges**. Each signal occupies a unique frequency band within the overall channel.
  - Example: **Radio broadcasting** uses FDM, where different radio stations transmit on different frequencies but share the same airwaves.
3. **Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM)**
  - WDM is a type of FDM used in **fiber optic communication**, where multiple light signals of different wavelengths (colors) are transmitted simultaneously through a single optical fiber.
  - Example: **Fiber optic** networks use WDM to transmit multiple data streams (e.g., internet, TV, and phone) through the same fiber cable.
4. **Code-Division Multiplexing (CDM)**
  - In CDM, multiple signals are transmitted simultaneously over the same frequency band, but **each signal is encoded with a unique code**. Receivers decode the signals using the corresponding code to separate them.
  - Example: CDM is used in **cellular networks** (such as 3G) to allow multiple users to share the same frequency without interference.

## Advantages of Multiplexing
  - **Efficient Resource Usage**: It allows the efficient use of a limited communication medium (e.g., bandwidth, fiber optic cables).
  - **Cost-Effective**: Sharing a single medium among multiple signals reduces the need for additional infrastructure.
  - **Scalability**: Allows for more devices or users to be connected over the same medium without significant upgrades.

## Real-World Examples
  - Internet Connections: **DSL and cable modems** use multiplexing to send and receive multiple streams of data over the same line.
  - TV Broadcasting: **Cable TV uses FDM** to send multiple channels over a single cable.
  - Mobile Communication: **Cellular networks use CDM** to allow multiple users to share the same frequencies.

## Summary
Multiplexing enables the efficient use of communication channels by allowing multiple signals to share the same medium, which increases capacity and reduces infrastructure costs.
