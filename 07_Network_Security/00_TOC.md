# Network Security
- [OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model](./01_OSI_Model.md)
    - Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
    - Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
    - Network; layer 3 (Routing).
    - Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
    - Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).
- [Firewall](./02_Firewall.md)
    - Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.
- [NAT (Network Address Translation)](./03_NAT.md)
    - Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
- [DNS (Domain Name System)](./04_DNS.md)
    - (53)
    - Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
    - In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain- 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.
    - DNS configs
        - Start of Authority (SOA).
        - IP addresses (A and AAAA).
        - SMTP mail exchangers (MX).
        - Name servers (NS).
        - Pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR).
        - Domain name aliases (CNAME).
- [DNS Exfiltration](./05_DNS_Exfiltration.md)
    - Sending data as subdomains.

    - Doesn’t show up in http logs. 
- [ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)](./06_ARP.md)
    - Pair MAC address with IP Address for IP connections. 
- [DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](./07_DHCP.md)
    - UDP (67 - Server, 68 - Client)
    - Dynamic address allocation (allocated by router).
    - `DHCPDISCOVER` -> `DHCPOFFER` -> `DHCPREQUEST` -> `DHCPACK`
- [Multiplexing](./08_Multiplexing.md)
    - Timeshare, statistical share, just useful to know it exists.
- [Traceroute](./09_Traceroute.md)
    - Usually uses UDP, but might also use ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN. TTL, or hop-limit.
    - Initial hop-limit is 128 for windows and 64 for *nix. Destination returns ICMP Echo Reply. 
- [Nmap (Network Mapper)](./10_Nmap.md)
    - Network scanning tool.
- [Person‐in‐the‐Middle (PitM)](./11_PitM.md)
    - Understand PKI (public key infrastructure in relation to this).
- [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](./12_VPN.md)
    - Hide traffic from ISP but expose traffic to VPN provider.
- [Tor (The Onion Router)](./13_Tor.md)
    - Traffic is obvious on a network.

    - Super important to learn this, includes learning about handshakes, encryption, signing, certificate authorities, trust systems. A good [primer](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1) on all these concepts and algorithms is made available by the Dutch cybersecurity center.
