## Network Security
- [OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model](./OSI_Model.md)
	- Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
	- Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
	- Network; layer 3 (Routing).
	- Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
	- Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).	
- [Firewall](./Firewall.md)
	- Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.	
- [NAT (Network Address Translation)](./NAT.md)
	- Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
- [DNS (Domain Name System)](./DNS.md)
	- (53)
	- Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
	- In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain- 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.
	- DNS configs
		- Start of Authority (SOA).
		- IP addresses (A and AAAA).
		- SMTP mail exchangers (MX).
		- Name servers (NS).
		- Pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR).
		- Domain name aliases (CNAME).
- [DNS Exfiltration](./DNS_Exfiltration.md)
	- Sending data as subdomains. 
	- 26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com
	- Doesn’t show up in http logs. 
- [ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)](./ARP.md)
	- Pair MAC address with IP Address for IP connections. 
- [DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](./DHCP.md)
	- UDP (67 - Server, 68 - Client)
	- Dynamic address allocation (allocated by router).
	- `DHCPDISCOVER` -> `DHCPOFFER` -> `DHCPREQUEST` -> `DHCPACK`
- [Multiplexing](./Multiplexing.md)
	- Timeshare, statistical share, just useful to know it exists.
- [Traceroute](./Traceroute.md)
	- Usually uses UDP, but might also use ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN. TTL, or hop-limit.
	- Initial hop-limit is 128 for windows and 64 for *nix. Destination returns ICMP Echo Reply. 
- [Nmap (Network Mapper)](./Nmap.md)
	- Network scanning tool.
- [Person‐in‐the‐Middle (PitM)](./PitM.md)
	- Understand PKI (public key infrastructure in relation to this).
- [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](./VPN.md)
	- Hide traffic from ISP but expose traffic to VPN provider.
- [Tor (The Onion Router)](./Tor.md)
	- Traffic is obvious on a network. 
	- [Investigating Individuals on Tor Networks](./Investigating_Individuals_on_Tor_Networks.md)
- [Proxy](./Proxy.md)
	- [7 Proxies won't help you](./7_Proxies.md)
- [BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)](./BGP.md)
	- Border Gateway Protocol.
	- Holds the internet together.
- [Network Traffic Analysis Tools](./Network_Traffic_Analysis_Tools.md)
	- Wireshark
	- Tcpdump
	- Burp suite
- [HTTP(S)](./HTTP_S.md)
	- (80, 443)
- [SSL/TLS](./SSL_TLS.md)

	- Super important to learn this, includes learning about handshakes, encryption, signing, certificate authorities, trust systems. A good [primer](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1) on all these concepts and algorithms is made available by the Dutch cybersecurity center.
	- POODLE, BEAST, CRIME, BREACH, HEARTBLEED.
- [TCP/UDP](./TCP_UDP.md)
	- Web traffic, chat, voip, traceroute.
	- TCP will throttle back if packets are lost but UDP doesn't. 
	- Streaming can slow network TCP connections sharing the same network.
- [ICMP](./ICMP.md)
	- Ping and traceroute.
- [Email Protocols](./Email_Protocols.md)
	- SMTP (25, 587, 465)
	- IMAP (143, 993)
	- POP3 (110, 995)
- [SSH](./SSH.md)
