# Privacy Incidents vs Information Security Incidents
“Privacy incidents” and “Information Security Incidents” are **distinct but often related terms in cybersecurity**, each with its focus and implications.

## Privacy Incidents
  - Privacy incidents involve the **unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure, or misuse of personal information, like names, addresses, or health data**. These incidents primarily **concern the privacy rights of individuals and can result in legal and regulatory implications, especially under laws like GDPR or HIPAA**.
    - Example: An employee unintentionally shares sensitive customer information with unauthorized individuals.

## Information Security Incidents
  - Information security incidents **cover a broader range of threats to information systems, including breaches that impact data integrity, availability, and confidentiality**. These incidents **may affect any type of data, not limited to personal information, and often involve threats like malware, unauthorized access, or denial-of-service attacks**.
  - Example: A system intrusion where a hacker compromises a database, potentially impacting data integrity and security.

## Summary
Understanding the difference is crucial because privacy incidents generally trigger specific privacy-related response actions, whereas information security incidents focus more broadly on protecting systems and data.
