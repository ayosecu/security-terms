# Know when to talk to legal, users, managers, directors
Knowing **when to involve** legal teams, users, managers, and directors is essential for effective incident management in cybersecurity.

## Legal Team
  - When: **As soon as an incident involves potential breaches of laws, regulations, or contractual obligations**. This includes privacy incidents involving personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property exposure, or regulatory compliance issues.
  - Why: Legal can help assess compliance obligations, guide responses to regulatory bodies, and mitigate potential liabilities.

## Users (Affected or Potentially Affected)
  - When: **Only when it’s confirmed** that their data or services have been impacted or might be at risk.
  - Why: Transparency is critical, especially for maintaining trust and meeting legal obligations (such as data breach notification laws). **Timing is crucial**; notifying users too early or too late can create confusion or reputational damage.

## Managers (Direct Supervisors or Team Leaders)
  - When: **Early in the incident** lifecycle, **as soon as the incident is confirmed** to require a response.
  - Why: Managers need to know promptly so they can allocate resources, support the incident response, and keep their teams informed and on standby as needed.

## Directors (Executive-Level, e.g., CISO or CTO)
  - When: For significant incidents that **could impact the organization’s reputation, operations, or finances**.
  - Why: Directors need the full scope to make informed, high-level decisions about resource allocation, public statements, and overall incident response strategy.

## Summary
This approach ensures that each stakeholder is engaged **at the right time**, helping to **keep the incident response streamlined, efficient, and legally compliant**.
