# Response Models
Both models **provide structure and ensure a systematic approach, reducing oversights and enabling continuous improvement**.

## 1. SANS PICERL Model
  - **Preparation**: Develop response playbooks, train teams, and establish clear protocols.
  - **Identification**: Detect, validate, and assess incidents.
  - **Containment**: Limit the attacker’s access without causing further harm.
  - **Eradication**: Remove the attacker from the environment.
  - **Recovery**: Restore normal operations securely.
  - **Lessons Learned**: Review the response, document findings, and adjust protocols.

## 2. Google’s IMAG (Incident Management at Google)
  - Focuses on: **Speed, scalability, and post-incident documentation**. IMAG emphasizes rapid response, clear communication, and **robust post-mortem analysis** to learn from every incident.
