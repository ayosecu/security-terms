## Run a scenario from A to Z
Let’s walk through a cybersecurity incident scenario, covering each stage and explaining when to engage each stakeholder and take critical actions.

## Scenario
Phishing Attack with Data Exposure
An employee unknowingly clicks on a phishing email link, which leads to unauthorized access to a database containing personal customer information.

## Step-by-Step Incident Response
1. **Detection and Initial Assessment**
  - Action: SOC (Security Operations Center) or security detection system flags unusual access patterns on the database.
  - Assess: Determine the scope — **confirm if it’s an actual incident**, and **identify what systems and data are impacted**.
  - Notify: **Contact managers as soon as the incident is verified**.

2. **Containment**
  - Action: **Isolate** affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
  - Internal Coordination:
    - **Inform legal** if PII or sensitive data exposure is suspected. Legal will begin reviewing regulatory requirements and prepare for potential disclosure obligations.
    - **Brief managers** to ensure immediate containment resources and communicate with affected teams.
  - User Involvement: If users’ accounts are directly impacted, **consider notifying them to be vigilant of suspicious activity**.

3. **Eradication**
  - Action: Analyze and **remove** phishing emails from the system, **close** exploited vulnerabilities, and enhance controls.
  - Legal Review: Reconfirm if there’s a need for regulatory reporting.
  - Directors Briefing: Notify directors if the attack is part of a larger threat pattern or could escalate to impact operations or reputation.

4. **Recovery**
  - Action: **Restore** systems and **monitor** closely to **prevent recurrence**.
  - Users Notified: If personal information was accessed, **inform impacted users per regulatory guidelines**.
  - Management Update: Ensure managers and directors are **updated with timelines and recovery status**.

5. **Post-Incident Review**
  - Action: **Conduct a root cause analysis, review the response process, and improve controls**.
  - **Management Debrief**: Report findings and lessons learned to managers and directors.
  - Legal Follow-Up: Legal may support final reporting or **address compliance concerns** that arose.
  - Users Communication: For significant incidents, **inform users** of corrective actions taken to improve security.

## Summary
This A-to-Z scenario demonstrates a structured approach:
  - **Early containment** and **collaboration with legal for compliance**.
  - **Timely updates to managers and directors** to ensure alignment on resources and response strategy.
  - **Transparent user communication** where relevant to maintain trust.
