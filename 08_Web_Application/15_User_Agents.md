# User Agent 
A User Agent is **a string sent in HTTP requests by clients (e.g., browsers, bots, or scripts) to identify themselves to servers**. The User Agent string includes details about the clientâ€™s software, operating system, and sometimes the version number.
**Attackers often spoof User Agents** to disguise their activities, making it critical to analyze User Agents to determine if requests are coming from legitimate browsers or potentially malicious botnets.

## 1. What Is a User Agent?
The User-Agent header is **included in HTTP requests**.

### Example User-Agent for a Legitimate Browser  

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.5790.171 Safari/537.36
```

### Breakdown
- Mozilla/5.0: Historical prefix for compatibility.
- Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64: Operating system and architecture.
- AppleWebKit/537.36: Browser engine.
- Chrome/115.0.5790.171: Browser name and version.
- Safari/537.36: Secondary engine for compatibility.  
<br>

## 2. How User Agents Are Used
  - **Identify Browsers**
    - Helps servers optimize content for specific browsers and devices.
  - **Detect Bots**
    - Some bots or crawlers have unique User-Agent strings (e.g., search engines like Googlebot).
  - **Filter Malicious Requests**
    - User-Agent analysis helps identify botnets or malicious scripts.
  - **Logging and Analytics**
    - Web logs rely on User-Agent strings to analyze traffic patterns.

## 3. Legitimate Browser vs. Botnet

### a. Characteristics of Legitimate User Agents
1. Valid Format
  - Legitimate browsers follow standardized User-Agent formats.
2. Matching Behavior
  - The User-Agent matches typical browser behavior (e.g., valid headers, cookies, and rendering requests).
3. Consistent Traffic
  - Human-driven browsing patterns include clicks, delays, and varied URLs.
4. Common Strings
  - Well-known browser strings like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

### b. Characteristics of Suspicious User Agents (Botnets or Scripts)
1. Missing or Generic Strings
  - Bots often use simplified or malformed User-Agent strings.
  - Example  

```
User-Agent: Python-urllib/3.7
```

2. Outdated or Nonexistent Browsers
  - Requests claim to use very old or invalid browser versions.
  - Example  

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; Win95)
```

3. Impersonating Legitimate Browsers
  - Bots mimic legitimate User-Agent strings but behave suspiciously (e.g., high request volume).
4. Rapid Traffic
  - Bots generate large numbers of requests in short timeframes (automation).
5. Missing Headers
  - Bots often send minimal or missing HTTP headers (e.g., no cookies, referrers).  
<br>

## 4. Tools to Analyze User Agents
1. Manual Analysis
  - Use tools like curl or browser dev tools to inspect User-Agent headers.
  - Example curl command  

```
curl -A "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" https://example.com
```

2. User Agent Parsers
  - Online tools to analyze and decode User-Agent strings
    - [WhatIsMyBrowser.com](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/)
    - [UserAgentString.com](https://www.useragentstring.com/)
3. Log Analysis Tools
  - Use log analysis tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to analyze User-Agent strings in HTTP logs.
4. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
  - Tools like ModSecurity, Cloudflare, or AWS WAF inspect User-Agents and block malicious ones.
5. Threat Intelligence Feeds
  - Use updated botnet and crawler User-Agent blacklists.  
<br>

## 5. Detecting Botnets or Malicious Clients

### a. Identify Known Bots
- Legitimate bots (e.g., Googlebot) announce themselves clearly.
- Verify IP ranges and perform reverse DNS lookups for confirmation.

### b. Check for Anomalies
- Compare User-Agent behavior to legitimate patterns
- Does it lack cookies or referrer headers?
- Does it send a flood of requests in rapid succession?

### c. User-Agent Blacklists
- **Maintain a list of known bad User-Agent strings**.
- Example of suspicious User-Agents  

```
User-Agent: curl/7.61.1
User-Agent: Python-requests/2.25.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Bot/1.0)
```

### d. Behavior-Based Detection
- Look beyond the User-Agent string and **analyze behavior**
- Traffic patterns: High-frequency requests from the same IP.
- Header consistency: Legitimate browsers typically include headers like Accept, Accept-Encoding, and Cookie.

## 6. Example of Legitimate vs. Malicious Traffic

| Aspect | Legitimate Browser | Botnet/Script |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------- |
| User-Agent String | Properly formatted (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). | Simplified, missing, or malformed. |
| Behavior | Human-like clicks and delays. | Rapid-fire requests with no delays. |
| HTTP Headers | Includes cookies, referrer, and accept headers. | Minimal headers, no cookies or referrers. |
| Traffic Volume | Low and varied. | High and repetitive. |
| IP Range | Distributed, user-based IPs. | Concentrated, unusual IPs. |  
<br>

## 7. Best Practices to Mitigate Malicious Bots
1. **Validate User-Agent Strings**
  - Use whitelists for known legitimate browsers.
2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
  - Restrict the number of requests per IP in a set timeframe.
3. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
  - Inspect and block suspicious User-Agent strings.
4. **Behavioral Analysis**
  - Monitor traffic patterns to identify automation.
5. **CAPTCHA Challenges**
  - Introduce CAPTCHAs for suspicious behavior to confirm human users.
6. **Threat Intelligence**
  - Update blacklists regularly to block known bad User-Agent strings.

## 8. Summary
| Aspect | Details |
| ------ | ------- |
| What is a User Agent? | A string that identifies the client (browser, bot, or script) to the server. |
| Legitimate Browsers | Use well-formatted, up-to-date User-Agent strings. |
| Botnet/Script Indicators | Simplified strings, high traffic, missing headers, or outdated versions. |
| Detection Methods | Manual analysis, log inspection, User-Agent parsing tools, WAF. |
| Mitigation | Validate strings, rate limit, implement behavioral analysis, use CAPTCHAs. |

While User-Agent strings are useful for identifying clients, they can be **easily spoofed**. To reliably differentiate legitimate browsers from botnets or scripts, **combine User-Agent validation with behavior-based analysis, rate limiting, and tools like web application firewalls**. Regularly updating detection techniques and leveraging threat intelligence ensures your systems stay protected.
