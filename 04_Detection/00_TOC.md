# Detection
  - [IDS](./01_IDS.md)
    - Intrusion Detection System (signature based (eg. snort) or behaviour based).
    - Snort/Suricata/YARA rule writing
    - Host-based Intrusion Detection System (eg. OSSEC)  
  - [SIEM](./02_SIEM.md)
    - Security Information and Event Management.  
  - [IOC](./03_IOC.md) 
    - Indicator of compromise (often shared amongst orgs/groups).
    - Specific details (e.g. IP addresses, hashes, domains)  
  - [Security Signals](./04_Security_Signals.md)
    - Things that create signals
      - Honeypots, snort.
    - Things that triage signals
      - SIEM, e.g. splunk.
    - Things that will alert a human 
      - Automatic triage of collated logs, machine learning.
      - Notifications and analyst fatigue.
      - Systems that make it easy to decide if alert is actual hacks or not.  
  - [Signatures](./05_Signatures.md)
    - Host-based signatures
      - E.g. changes to the registry, files created or modified.
      - Strings in found in malware samples appearing in binaries installed on hosts (/Antivirus).
    - Network signatures
      - E.g. checking DNS records for attempts to contact C2 (command and control) servers.  
  - [Anomaly or Behavior Based Detection](./06_Anomaly_or_Behavior_Based_Detection.md)
    - IDS learns model of “normal” behaviour, then can detect things that deviate too far from normal
      - E.g. unusual urls being accessed, user specific
      - login times / usual work hours, normal files accessed.
    - Can also look for things that a hacker might specifically do (eg, HISTFILE commands, accessing /proc).
    - If someone is inside the network- If action could be suspicious, increase log verbosity for that user.  
  - [Firewall Rules](./07_Firewall_Rules.md)
    - Brute force (trying to log in with a lot of failures).
    - Detecting port scanning (could look for TCP SYN packets with no following SYN ACK/ half connections).
    - Antivirus software notifications.
    - Large amounts of upload traffic.  
  - [Honeypots](./08_Honeypots.md)
    - Canary tokens.
    - Dummy internal service / web server, can check traffic, see what attacker tries.  
  - [Things to Know About Attackers](./09_Things_to_Know_About_Attackers.md)
    - Slow attacks are harder to detect.
    - Attacker can spoof packets that look like other types of attacks, deliberately create a lot of noise.
    - Attacker can spoof IP address sending packets, but can check TTL of packets and TTL of reverse lookup to find spoofed addresses.
    - Correlating IPs with physical location (is difficult and inaccurate often).  
  - [Logs to Look at](./10_Logs_to_Look_at.md)
    - DNS queries to suspicious domains.
    - HTTP headers could contain wonky information.
    - Metadata of files (eg. author of file) (more forensics?).
    - Traffic volume.
    - Traffic patterns.
    - Execution logs.  
  - [Detection Related Tools](./11_Detection_Related_Tools.md)
    - Splunk.
    - Arcsight.
    - Qradar.
    - Darktrace.
    - Tcpdump.
    - Wireshark.
    - Zeek.
