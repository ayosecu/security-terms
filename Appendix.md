### Summary
1. Know What You Are Protecting and Why
Develop situational awareness through understanding the mission; legal regulatory environment; technical and data environment; user, user behaviors and service interactions; and the threat. Prioritize gaining insights into critical systems and data and iterate understanding over time.

2. Give the SOC the Authority to Do Its Job
Empower the SOC to carry out the desired functions, scope, partnerships, and responsibilities through an approved charter and the SOCs alignment within the organization.

3. Build a SOC Structure to Match Your Organizational Needs
Structure SOCs by considering the constituency, SOC functions and responsibilities, service availability, and any operational efficiencies gained by selecting one construct over another.

4. Hire AND Grow Quality Staff
Create an environment to attract the right people and encourage them to stay through career progression opportunities and great culture and operating environment. Plan for turnover and build a pipeline to hire. Consider how many personnel are needed for the different SOC
functions.

5. Prioritize Incident Response
Prepare for handling incidents by defining incident categories, response steps, and escalation paths, and codifying those into SOPs and playbooks. Determine the priorities of incidents for the organization and allocate the resources to respond. Execute response with precision and care toward constituency mission and business.

6. Illuminate Adversaries with Cyber Threat Intelligence
Tailor the collection and use of cyber threat intelligence by analyzing the intersection of adversary information, organization relevancy, and technical environment to prioritize defenses, monitoring, and other actions.

7. Select and Collect the Right Data
Choose data by considering relative value of different data types such as sensor and log data collected by network and host systems, cloud resources, applications, and sensors. Consider the trade-offs of too little data and therefore not having the relevant information available and too much data such that tools and analysts become overwhelmed.

8. Leverage Tools to Support Analyst Workflow
Consolidate and harmonize views into tools and data and integrate them to maximize SOC workflow. Consider how the many SOC tools, including SIEM, UEBA, SOAR, and others fit in with the organizationâ€™s technical landscape, to include cloud and OT environments.

9. Communicate Clearly, Collaborate Often, Share Generously
Engage within the SOC, with stakeholders and constituents, and with the broader cyber community to evolve capabilities and contribute to the overall security of the broader community.

10. Measure Performance to Improve Performance
Determine qualitative and quantitative measures to know what is working well, and where to improve. A SOC metrics program includes business objectives, data sources and collection, data synthesis, reporting, and decision-making and action.

11. Turn up the Volume by Expanding SOC Functionality
Enhance SOC activities to include threat hunting, red teaming, deception, malware analysis, forensics, and/or tabletop exercises, once incident response is mature. Any of these can improve the SOCs operating ability and increase the likelihood of finding more sophisticated adversaries.
