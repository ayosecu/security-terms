# Impact
In the impact phase of an attack, **the attacker executes actions that disrupt, degrade, or manipulate systems and data, often to achieve specific goals such as financial gain, reputational harm, or operational disruption**. The impact phase includes techniques like deleting accounts or data, encrypting files (e.g., ransomware), defacing websites, and causing denial of service (DoS) or forced shutdowns.

## 1. Deleted Accounts or Data, Encrypt Data (like Ransomware)
  - **Deleted Accounts or Data**
    - Definition: Attackers may delete user accounts or critical data to disrupt operations, cause financial damage, or erase traces of their presence.
    - Purpose: This tactic is often used to sabotage organizations, hinder recovery, or remove evidence.
    - Examples: Deleting system administrators’ accounts, removing database records, or erasing critical files.
  - **Encrypt Data (Ransomware)**
    - Definition: In a ransomware attack, attackers encrypt files and **demand payment in exchange for the decryption key**.
    - Purpose: Ransomware is typically financially motivated, though some attackers may use it for sabotage.
    - Examples: Encrypting data on file servers, databases, or workstations, rendering them unusable until the ransom is paid.
  - Security Implications: Deleting data or accounts can cause significant operational disruption and financial losses. **Ransomware can halt entire business operations, often leading to reputational and financial damage**. Even if the ransom is paid, there’s no guarantee of full data recovery.

## 2. Defacement
  - Definition: **Defacement** is the unauthorized modification of a website or web application’s content, typically replacing it with messages or imagery chosen by the attacker.
  - Purpose: Defacement is often intended to damage reputations, spread propaganda, or make a public statement. It is common in hacktivism, where attackers want to send a message or embarrass the target.
  - Examples: Changing a website’s homepage to display an attacker’s message or logo, posting offensive or politically motivated content, or replacing brand imagery with malicious graphics.
  - Security Implications: Defacement impacts public perception and credibility, especially if customers or stakeholders see the altered content before it’s corrected. It’s also an indicator that attackers had access to modify web server files, suggesting further vulnerabilities in the web application or server.

## 3. Denial of Service (DoS), Shutdown/Reboot Systems
  - Denial of Service (DoS)
    - Definition: Attackers overload a system or network with traffic, consuming resources and rendering the **service unavailable** to legitimate users.
    - Types
      - Application-Layer DoS: Targeting specific applications (e.g., web servers) with traffic to exhaust resources.
      - **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: **Using multiple systems (often a botnet) to amplify traffic** and overwhelm the target.
    - Shutdown/Reboot Systems
      - Definition: Attackers force systems to shut down or reboot, disrupting ongoing operations and potentially causing data loss or damage.
      - Purpose: Shutdowns and reboots disrupt availability and can trigger a lengthy recovery process, especially for critical systems.
    - Security Implications: DoS attacks and forced shutdowns can cause significant operational downtime, impact customer experience, and lead to financial losses. Repeated forced shutdowns can also damage hardware or cause data corruption.

## Summary
  - Deleted Accounts or Data, Encrypt Data (Ransomware) are **destructive tactics** that disrupt access to essential resources, leading to potential data loss, operational delays, or ransom demands.
  - Defacement harms an organization’s **reputation** and publicly signals a security breach, affecting **credibility** and customer **trust**.
  - Denial of Service (DoS) and Forced Shutdowns/Reboots **degrade system availability**, disrupt business operations, and can cause significant financial and operational impact.

Understanding these impact techniques helps organizations **prepare and implement preventive measures such as regular data backups, access control management, incident response plans, and DDoS mitigation strategies**. By planning for potential impact scenarios, organizations can minimize the damage caused by these types of attacks and recover more quickly.
