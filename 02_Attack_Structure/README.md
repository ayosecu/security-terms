## Attack Structure
Practice describing security concepts in the context of an attack. These categories are a rough guide on attack structure for a targeted attack. Non-targeted attacks tend to be a bit more "all-in-one".

- [Reconnaissance](./Reconnaissance.md)
	- OSINT, Google dorking, Shodan.
- [Resource Development](./Resource_Development.md)
	- Get infrastructure (via compromise or otherwise).
	- Build malware.
	- Compromise accounts.
- [Initial Access](./Initial_Access.md)
	- Phishing.
	- Hardware placements.
	- Supply chain compromise.
	- Exploit public-facing apps.
- [Execution](./Execution.md)
	- Shells & interpreters (powershell, python, javascript, etc.).
	- Scheduled tasks, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
- [Persistence](./Persistence.md)
	- Additional accounts/creds.
	- Start-up/log-on/boot scripts, modify launch agents, DLL side-loading, Webshells.
	- Scheduled tasks.
- [Privilege Escalation](./Privilege_Escalation.md)
	- Sudo, token/key theft, IAM/group policy modification.
	- Many persistence exploits are PrivEsc methods too.
- [Defense Evasion](./Defense_Evasion.md)
	- Disable detection software & logging.
	- Revert VM/Cloud instances.
	- Process hollowing/injection, bootkits.
- [Credential Access](./Credential_Access.md)
	- Brute force, access password managers, keylogging.
	- etc/passwd & etc/shadow.
	- Windows DCSync, Kerberos Gold & Silver tickets.
	- Clear-text creds in files/pastebin, etc.
- [Discovery](./Discovery.md)
	- Network scanning.
	- Find accounts by listing policies.
	- Find remote systems, software and system info, VM/sandbox.
- [Lateral Movement](./Lateral_Movement.md)
	- SSH/RDP/SMB.
	- Compromise shared content, internal spear phishing.
	- Pass the hash/ticket, tokens, cookies.
- [Collection](./Collection.md)
	- Database dumps.
	- Audio/video/screen capture, keylogging.
	- Internal documentation, network shared drives, internal traffic interception.
- [Exfiltration](./Exfiltration.md)
	- Removable media/USB, Bluetooth exfil.
	- C2 channels, DNS exfil, web services like code repos & Cloud backup storage.
	- Scheduled transfers.
- [Command and Control (C2)](./Command_and_Control.md)
	- Web service (dead drop resolvers, one-way/bi-directional traffic), encrypted channels.
	- Removable media.
	- Steganography, encoded commands.
- [Impact](./Impact.md)
	- Deleted accounts or data, encrypt data (like ransomware).
	- Defacement.
	- Denial of service, shutdown/reboot systems.
