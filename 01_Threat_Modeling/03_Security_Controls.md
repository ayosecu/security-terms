# Security Controls
Security controls are **measures implemented to reduce risk, protect assets, and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information systems**. They are **used to prevent, detect, mitigate, and respond to threats and vulnerabilities** in a system or network. Security controls can be **technical, physical, or administrative in nature, and they work together to create a layered defense** that safeguards an organization’s data and resources.

## Types of Security Controls
1. **Preventive** Controls
  - Purpose: Prevent security incidents by stopping unauthorized access or actions before they occur.
  - Examples
    - **Firewalls**: Block unauthorized access to network resources.
    - **Access Control**: Limits access based on roles, permissions, or attributes to ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions.
    - **Encryption**: Protects data in transit or at rest, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires additional verification factors for access, reducing the risk of unauthorized login.
2. **Detective** Controls
  - Purpose: Identify and detect incidents or suspicious activities in real time, allowing for a quick response.
  - Examples
    - **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic to detect potential threats, such as malware or port scanning.
    - **SIEM** Systems: Collects and analyzes log data from various sources to detect security incidents and generate alerts.
    - **File Integrity Monitoring**: Tracks changes to critical files, alerting security teams of unexpected modifications.
    - **Security Audits**: Regular audits to detect non-compliance with security policies and procedures.
3. **Corrective** Controls
  - Purpose: Respond to and fix issues after they have been detected, minimizing the impact of an incident.
  - Examples
    - **Patching**: Applies updates to software and systems to fix vulnerabilities after they’ve been identified.
    - **Backup and Restore**: Restores data or systems to an operational state following a compromise, such as ransomware.
    - **Incident Response**: Steps taken by a security team to contain, investigate, and mitigate the effects of an attack.
4. **Deterrent** Controls
  - Purpose: Discourage attackers from attempting to breach systems by increasing the perceived difficulty of an attack.
  - Examples
    - **Security Awareness Training**: Educates employees on security best practices, reducing the likelihood of social engineering attacks.
    - **Warning Signs and Legal Notices**: Visible signs indicating that unauthorized access is monitored, deterring potential attackers.
    - **Physical Security Measures**: Security cameras, guards, and signage that deter unauthorized access.
5. **Compensating** Controls
  - Purpose: Provide alternative protections when primary controls cannot be implemented.
  - Examples
    - **Network Segmentation**: Divides the network into isolated segments to limit access to sensitive areas.
    - **Application Whitelisting**: Allows only trusted applications to run, providing security when full application control isn’t possible.
    - **Access Logging and Monitoring**: Used as a compensating control when strict access control mechanisms are unavailable.
6. **Physical** Controls
  - Purpose: Protect the physical infrastructure where data and systems are stored, limiting access to authorized personnel.
  - Examples
    - **Locks**: Secures doors, cabinets, or equipment from unauthorized access.
    - **Security Cameras**: Monitor physical spaces to detect and deter unauthorized access.
    - **Biometric Scanners**: Use physical characteristics, like fingerprints or retina scans, to verify identity.
7. **Administrative** Controls
  - Purpose: Implement policies, procedures, and guidelines to manage security within an organization.
  - Examples
    - **Security Policies**: Define acceptable use, data protection, and access control policies.
    - **Incident Response Plan**: Provides steps for responding to and recovering from security incidents.
    - **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates and prioritizes security risks within the organization to focus on critical areas.
    - **Employee Training and Awareness**: Educates staff on security protocols and how to recognize potential threats.

## Importance of Layered Security Controls
**A strong security posture relies on a combination of these security controls**. Using multiple types of controls in a layered or **defense-in-depth** approach creates redundancies, so if one control fails, others are still in place to protect assets. For instance, even if a firewall (preventive) is bypassed, an intrusion detection system (detective) can still alert security teams of suspicious activity, and backup systems (corrective) can recover lost data.

## Summary
Security Controls are critical measures to protect information and systems from security threats. They can be **preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating, physical, or administrative**. Each type serves a unique role in securing an organization, and **together they provide a robust defense strategy to detect, prevent, and respond to potential security incidents**.
